# Bulldozer-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
We're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project to use the characteristics of bulldozers and their past sales prices to predict the sale price of future bulldozers based on their characteristics.

* Inputs: Bulldozer characteristics such as make year, base model, model series, state of sale (e.g. which US state was it sold in), drive system and more.
* Outputs: Bulldozer sale price (in USD).
Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a regression problem.

And since we're going to predicting results with a time component (predicting future sales based on past sales), this is also known as a time series or forecasting problem.
